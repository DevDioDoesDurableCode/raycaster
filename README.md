#This is the code for a scanner that was placed on a robot in the FTC season of  2017-2018. The purpose of the scanner was to gather data about the robot's environment so it could navigate it and pick up objects without any human intervention. We used a Modern Robotics Range Sensor(https://modernroboticsinc.com/product/range-sensor/) mounted on a Rev Smart Servo(http://www.revrobotics.com/rev-41-1097/) for more precise movement. The way the system worked was by taking distance readings while turning the servo 180 degrees, making a dataset of 180 measurements (in cm) with each of the array ids corresponding to the angle the servo was at that time. The program would take this data and plot each distance on a grid, and proceed to try and find cubes to pick up. 

#Unfortunately, the sensor we picked for this project was inaccurate(due to it being an ultrasonic sensor and having incorrect sonic readings) and couldn’t be used for this project. We didn’t have enough time to get a new sensor so we had to scrap this part of the robot.
